About Astria
Welcome. My name is Deaven, and I am the creator behind Astria TV and the Astria Waves project. Our mission is to explore the profound connections between sound, consciousness, and well-being.

Whether you're exploring deep-seated theories on our YouTube channel or experiencing the tangible effects of our sound frequencies, you are part of a community dedicated to uncovering suppressed knowledge and empowering personal healing.

My Journey to Frequencies
For over 15 years, I have been deeply immersed in the world of music. As a musician, songwriter for over 200 artists, and composer for commercials, books, and shows, I've always understood that music, at its core, is the art of frequency. This understanding led me on a decade-long journey to study the science and spirit of sound, inspired by the groundbreaking work of researchers like Dr. Masaru Emoto and the Monroe Institute.

Like many, my path was driven by a personal need. I've navigated the challenges of severe anxiety and panic attacks for years. This experience pushed me past conventional solutions and into the world of frequency healing. The result of this research was Neuro-Calm 204, a frequency I created to manage my own anxiety. When I discovered its profound effectiveness—not just sometimes, but every time—I knew I had to share it.

My passions are diverse—I am an author, creator, game developer, and musician—but they are all united by a single purpose: to create experiences that heal, enlighten, and empower.

The Power of Sound: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Application
We believe that the most powerful tools for healing are not always found in a bottle, but within the natural, resonant frequencies of the universe.

Ancient Knowledge: Cultures throughout history knew that specific tones could calm the body, sharpen the mind, induce sleep, and alleviate pain. This wisdom, from the harmonic architecture of ancient sites to the resonant bells in historic buildings, has been largely suppressed in favor of modern pharmacology.

Our Philosophy: We believe in reclaiming this knowledge. The frequencies offered here are built on the same principles as proven modalities like Hemi-Sync and Septasync. They are designed to work with your body's own electrical nature to help you find balance and relief naturally.

Support Our Mission
Our goal is to make these transformative tools accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.

On Patreon: You can find my exclusive frequencies, books, and other creative works here. Your support on Patreon is what allows me to continue my research and create new content for the Astria TV channel and brand. We've set the price at the lowest possible tier on Patreon to ensure affordability.

Free Access: For those who cannot offer financial support, we've made it a priority to provide access. All of our frequencies are available for free through our web-hosted app, Astria Waves.

Thank you for being here and for supporting a vision of a healthier, more harmonious world.
